# Introduction

The NBA is an increasingly global league where its top talent comes from countries all over the world and colleges around the United States. Over the years, more and more of the NBA’s All-Star talent have come from outside the United States, which has brought along many fans globally. As fans of basketball, we were very interested in looking at how many NBA All-Stars (or the NBA’s best players) come from countries other than the United States and how international talent has grown over the years.

Additionally, as Duke and college basketball fans, we wanted to explore which colleges had the most NBA All-Stars and which states had the most colleges with top NBA talent too. We chose to analyze which colleges produce the best NBA players and draw conclusions to see if the best NBA players come from prominent college basketball schools, such as Duke or Kentucky, or from colleges that aren’t as consistently good at basketball. Our Shiny App enables users to analyze which colleges are most useful in producing NBA All-Star players, and where these colleges are found.

Our Shiny App also includes an interactive section that allows users to visualize where NBA All-Stars were from originally (that includes both a world map and a map of the US to see which states they are from) and see how that has changed over the years. This could also be used by NBA talent evaluators and general managers to see how important international scouting is and whether they should focus a lot of their attention going into an NBA draft on foreign players.


# Data

This data comes from [Basketball Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/), [Real GM](https://basketball.realgm.com/), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Module:College_color/data), [The United States Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/technical-documentation/research/evaluation-estimates/2020-evaluation-estimates/2010s-totals-national.html), & [The United States Department of Education](https://data.ed.gov/dataset/college-scorecard-all-data-files-through-6-2020/resources). Data from  Wikipedia, Basketball Reference, and RealGM was scraped by us. Prior to scraping data, we verified using the `robots.txt` file that the data was scrape-able.

# Research Questions

1. Which colleges did the most NBA All-Star players attend? Geographically, which regions in the US are those colleges in that produce the most NBA All-Star players?

2. What proportion of NBA All-Stars were drafted in the first round of the NBA draft? Which teams did these All-Stars play for?

3. Where are NBA All-Stars originally from geographically? How many All-Stars, on average, are there from outside the United States per year?


# NBA All-Stars by College

Our third research question was primarily motivated by our group members being Duke basketball fans and fans of college basketball as a whole. We wanted to do a deeper dive into relationships between college basketball teams and NBA player success. In our analysis, we defined a player's college as being the place that they attended immediately prior to starting their NBA career, regardless of whether they graduated.

In our Shiny App, we explored these relationships in the first three tabs: the "Colleges", "College Map", and "College State" tabs.

In the "Colleges" tab, we created a dynamic racing bar chart that measures the amount of All-Stars a college has produced since the introduction of the All-Star game in 1951. We allow the user to define whether they would like to count every appearance made in an All-Star game or to only count each player once per college, even if they made several All-Star games. We also allowed the user to define the length of the animation, the number of frames per second, and the length of the pause at the end of the animation loop. We chose to let the user define the year range for the animation and the number of colleges to include in the ranking. Our options provided are shown below.

!["Colleges" tab user interface](images/colleges-tab.png){width=50%}

To give us a broad sense of what colleges have been most successful in producing All-Star NBA players, we chose to plot the number of All-Star game appearances over time by college, yielding the result that Kentucky, UCLA, and UNC are the leaders of the pack.

One thing I should point out here is the use of University colors to give the plot more life (which took way more effort than I had anticipated).

![Total All-Star appearances by college, 1951-2021](images/all_stars_by_college_total_app.gif){width=50%}

To account for the fact that some players may have accounted for many All-Star appearances, we then limit the query to count just the number of players who have made an All-Star game, rather than the total amount of appearances. Unsurprisingly, this plot shows similar results, however Duke does leap UNC in cumulative All-Star players, undoubtedly due to the fact that Michael Jordan's 14 appearances in the prestigious game are only counting as one tally in UNC's column here.

One aspect of this data that we were keen to explore was the recent years. In 2006, the NBA instituted the "One-and-Done" rule, requiring players to be one year removed from high school before entering the NBA draft. This meant elite high school basketball players would be significantly more likely to spend at least one year in college prior to joining the NBA, contrasting the trend of players joining the NBA immediately following high school that had persisted in years prior. In the wake of this rule, colleges like Kentucky and Duke elected to pursue these elite athletes, valuing their basketball ability highly and dismissing concerns about the lack of continuity that would result from players coming and going yearly.

We chose to plot the same data as previously, limiting the starting year to be 2007, which was the first All-Star that "One-and-Dones" were in the NBA for.

![All-Star players by college, 2007-2021](images/all_stars_by_college_by_player_oad.gif){width=50%}

In both total All-Star game appearances and number of players with an All-Star appearance, Kentucky has dominated the "One-and-Done" era, offering evidence for our hypothesis. Duke has had six All-Star players in the same era, good enough for second place. The effect of one dominant player can be seen clearly in the first chart, with Texas' Kevin Durant's 11 All-Star game appearances propelling Texas to a second place finish in the timespan. Kevin Durant was a "One-and-Done" player, drafted second overall in the 2007 NBA draft.


To find where NBA players attended colleges geographically, we plotted both a chloropleth map of states and a point location map showing where players have attended. Customizability for the user in the Shiny App is shown below.

!["Colleges Map" tab user interface](images/colleges-loc-tab.png){width=50%}

!["College State" tab user interface](images/collegesmap-tab.png){width=50%}

We chose to use our Shiny App to examine the geography of where NBA All-Stars have gone to college over time.

![Map of All-Star players' college locations, 1951-2021](images/all_stars_by_location_college_map.gif){width=50%}

We then chose to look on a bigger scale, comparing across states. To avoid problems that arise with red-green colorblindness, we chose a blue-red color palette, using the NBA logo's colors for guidance.

![All-Star players' college locations by state, 1951-2021](images/all_stars_by_state.png)

California, North Carolina, and Kentucky stand out most among states. However, because states with many people in them would be more likely to have NBA All-Star players attend college there, we wanted to standardize states for comparison by population.

![All-Star players' college locations by state (per million residents), 1951-2021](images/all_stars_by_state_pc.png)

After normalizing states, Kentucky and North Carolina are still among the leaders. These states feature heralded basketball programs from which many great NBA players have emerged. Wyoming and Montana also stand out, but their values are more a product of their minuscule populations.


Which colleges did the most NBA All-Star players attend? Geographically, which regions in the US are those colleges in that produce the most NBA All-Star players?





# NBA All-Stars by Draft, Team


For our second question, we wanted to see how important early picks in the NBA draft are for finding the best players. We created an animated, racing bar chart to illustrate the number of All-Stars that were drafted in the first round, second round, or went undrafted and how that has shifted over the years. This could be used by NBA front offices to determine how important a first round pick is and how much a second round pick is really worth in trade scenarios. It was also interesting for us to look at how many undrafted All-Stars there have been, as we hypothesized that would be a very small percentage of the NBA's top talent.

Another hypothesis we had was that a lot of the NBA's top talent comes from the same few organizations over the years (such as the Boston Celtics and LA Lakers). We were interested in exploring the number of All-Stars per team over the years to draw conclusions on the distribution of talent in the NBA.

We also wanted to see which teams have had the most cumulative All-Star selections, so we created an interactive plot to address the second part of this research question. This was interesting for our group as we hypothesized that there would be a significant difference in the number of All-Stars from larger markets (like Los Angeles, New York, and Miami) versus small market cities (such as Memphis or Minneapolis). We wanted to analyze if the location of cities plays a significant in attracting "All-Star" talent to the same few teams.

First, for the "Draft Positions" tab to clean up the data I had to create a new variable called "draft_range" that used the str_detect function to determine whether each NBA All-Star was a first round pick, second round pick, or went undrafted. I also created a new variable called "sum_all_stars" which I used to count how many All-Stars there were from draft category each year. 

Our Shiny App displays the distribution of which NBA draft picks cumulatively (over a range of years) are from each round of the draft or are undrafted. The distribution over the full range of years is illustrated below:

![All-Star appearances by draft round](images/NBADraftDistribution.png){width=50%}

As you can see above, from 1951 to 2021 there have been significantly more total All-Star appearances from first round picks compared to both second round picks and undrafted players. There have been ~1300 cumulative first round pick All-Star selections compared to ~200 from the secound round and ~150 undrafted All-Stars. This distribution demonstrated the importance of earlier draft picks as this plot shows that over 75% of All-Star selections come from the first round of the draft. This outcome could encourage the idea of "tanking" as, if bad teams lose on purpose, they could get earlier draft picks. However, despite the large majority of All-Star selections being from the first round, second round picks are often basically traded away for little to no value and do not hold much trade value. Our group concluded that NBA general managers should still hold some value on those picks, as, we felt that the distribution is large enough to demonstrate that those picks are worth holding onto. We concluded that it is also worth it for teams to consider picking up undrafted players, they are almost 10% of the NBA's All-Stars over the last 70 years and are often on much smaller contracts and are, therefore, low risk investments. However, more recently (as you can see by adjusting the range of years on the app) the proportion of second round picks and undrafted All-Star selections has decreased. For example, since 2010 there has not been any undrafted All-Star selections, which could signify that NBA teams are doing a better job drafting and undrafted players have less value than they did previously. 


Next, for the "Team" tab, we looked at the distribution of total All-Star appearances for each team over a range of years. First, as many teams have changed cities and/or names over the course of the last 70 years, I used the mutate variable to rename each team by their current name and city. For example, the Los Angeles Lakers used to be the Minneapolis Lakers, so I used the mutate function so the total All-Stars would all be shown under the name "Los Angeles Lakers". I also, similarly, created a new variable called "sum_all_stars" which I used after using the pivot functions to count how many All-Stars there were from draft category each year. Finally, for this chart I added a variable called "number_to_rank" that would allow the user to choose the number of teams he wants displayed. The default is set at all 30 teams, but if the user wanted a closer look at the teams with the most All-Stars, you could change the teams to range to 10, for example, and the app would only display the teams with the 10 most All-Stars cumulatively each year. The distribution over the full range of years is illustrated below:

![All-Star appearances by NBA team](images/NBATeamDistribution.png)

As you could see in the plot above, the larger market teams (from bigger, more attractive cities) have had pretty significantly more All-Star selections than most of the smaller market teams. Four of the top five teams with the most total All-Star appearances are from bigger markets in Boston, LA, Philadelphia, and New York. The teams with the lowest amount of total All-Star appearances are from smaller market cities, including Memphis, Charlotte, New Orleans, and Minnesota. 

The difference in the distribution of All-Stars was more significant than we originally anticipated as well. For example, the Celtics and Lakers have both had over 140 All-Stars, while 22 of the 30 NBA teams have had less than 80 total All-Star appearances.

The total All-Star appearances could be explained by bigger markets, but also by managers building successful teams that resulted in more championships. The Lakers and Celtics have not only had the most All-Stars but they have had the most NBA championships. This is likely due to a combination of team and draft success, as well as their cities being attractive enough to bring in the best NBA players. The distribution of talent in the NBA clearly has not been even over the course of the league's history, and it is clear that the influence of cities that players may be more likely to want to play in plays a pretty significant factor in that distribution.

# Overall Conclusions

In examining colleges, we found that Kentucky and Duke have emerged in recent years as All-Star producing powerhouses. After the introduction of the "One-and-Done" rule in 2006, both schools have elected to pursue elite high school basketball players which has enabled them to see their former players thrive in the NBA. UNC and UCLA are other schools that have produced many All-Star players, which is reasonable, as both schools have had immense success throughout their histories.
