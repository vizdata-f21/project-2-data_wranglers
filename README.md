# Introduction

The NBA is an increasingly global league where its top talent comes from countries all over the world and colleges around the United States. Over the years, more and more of the NBA's All-Star talent have come from outside the United States, which has brought along many fans globally. As fans of basketball, we were very interested in looking at how many NBA All-Stars (or the NBA's best players) come from countries other than the United States and how international talent has grown over the years. Our Shiny app includes an interactive section that allows users to visualize where NBA All-Stars were from originally (that includes both a world map and a map of the US to see which states they are from) and see how that has changed over the years. This could also be used by NBA talent evaluators and general managers to see how important international scouting is and whether they should focus a lot of their attention going into an NBA draft on foreign players.

In many professional sports, there is also the concept of "tanking" where teams that are not expected to do well, start to lose games on purpose to get a higher draft pick. For one of our research questions, we were interested in doing an analysis on whether earlier round draft picks were much more important in leading to players that make the All-Star game versus second round picks or undrafted players. Therefore, we could analyze and draw conclusions on whether the idea of "tanking" is valid for NBA teams or if they should just try to win as many games as they can. 

Next, another hypothesis we had was that a lot of the NBA's top talent comes from the same few organizations over the years (such as the Boston Celtics and LA Lakers). One of the tabs in our Shiny app explored the number of All-Stars per team over the years to draw conclusions on the distribution of talent in the NBA.

Finally, as fans of college basketball as well we wanted to explore which colleges had the most NBA All-Stars, as well as which states had the most colleges with top NBA talent too. This could be used by NBA talent evaluaters and front offices as well to see which colleges produce the best NBA players and will allow us to draw conclusions to see if the best NBA players come from prominent college basketball schools, such as Duke or Kentucky, or from colleges that aren't as consistently good at basketball.

We built a shiny app with visualizations based on this NBA All-Star data that addressed all our hypotheses and ideas above, as well as looked at data that could help NBA team's more effectively make management decisions. We will answer each of our three research questions, described with more depth below, with interactive visualizations in our Shiny app.

# NBA Players Geographical Data

This project intends to use a Shiny app to examine where NBA players and NBA All-Stars originate from. It will showcase both players' hometowns and the location of their college. Our project proposal is found in the Proposal folder.
